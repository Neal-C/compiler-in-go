 # Compiler in go
 
## Following Thorsten's Ball : https://compilerbook.com/
## This is the sequel to : https://interpreterbook.com/

### Prequel repository here : https://github.com/Neal-C/interpreter-in-go

# Work in progress (_book is 278 pages..._)
 
###  Learned and done :
- Defined OpCodes
- Built bytecode
- Made a Stack machine with a symbol table
- Written a compiler
- Written a Virtual Machine

All done in TDD fashion


Fun facts ðŸ˜€ :
- the LLVM & Clang projects currently consist of around 3 million lines of code. 
- The GNU Compiler Collection, GCC, is even bigger. 15 million lines of code ðŸ˜±
